Sure! Hereâ€™s the revised text with "ConcurrentDining" replacing "Philosophers" and smoothed out:

** ConcurrentDining - Dining Philosophers Problem Solver

Welcome to ConcurrentDining, a project that tackles the classic Dining Philosophers problem, exploring synchronization and parallel programming concepts. This project challenges you to implement a solution that allows philosophers to dine peacefully while avoiding conflicts over shared resources, emphasizing concurrent programming skills and system-level understanding.

** Project Overview **

- What does ConcurrentDining do?
    - ConcurrentDining is an implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic synchronization challenge in computer science. The project simulates a scenario where philosophers must contend for shared resources (the dining table) without encountering deadlock or resource contention issues. It serves as a practical exploration of parallel programming and synchronization mechanisms.

- Key Features
    - Concurrency Handling: ConcurrentDining implements a solution to allow philosophers to dine concurrently without conflicts, demonstrating effective synchronization mechanisms.
    - Resource Management: The project explores efficient resource management to ensure philosophers can access shared resources without encountering race conditions or deadlocks.
    - Optimization Challenges: ConcurrentDining includes optimization challenges, such as minimizing resource contention or achieving optimal resource utilization.

** How to Compile ConcurrentDining **

To compile the ConcurrentDining program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
      - `git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/C-ConcurrentDining.git`
      - `cd C-ConcurrentDining/project`
  - Compile the Program:
      - `make`: This will generate the `dining` executable.
  - Clean the Build:
      - `make clean`: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can run ConcurrentDining to observe the synchronized dining of philosophers! **

** Usage Example **

`./dining number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`

For example:

`./dining 5 800 200 200`

(This will run the simulation with 5 philosophers, a time to die of 800 milliseconds, a time to eat of 200 milliseconds, and a time to sleep of 200 milliseconds.)
